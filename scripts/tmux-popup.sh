# tmux-popup.sh — launch a tmux popup running a command, with named geometry
# presets. Centralizes the `display-popup -E` + geometry + version-gate
# boilerplate the popup keybindings would otherwise repeat (and the fragile
# nested quoting of wrapping display-popup inside run-shell).
#
# Keybindings call this via run-shell so tmux formats (#{client_tty}, ...) are
# expanded into argv before the popup launches.
#
# Usage:
#   tmux-popup.sh <size> [-d <start-dir>] -- <command> [args...]
#
# Sizes:
#   half     -w 50%  -h 50%            (centered)
#   full     -w 100% -h 100%           (centered; "mobile" mode, max space)
#   scan     -x R -y 0 -w 65% -h 20    (top-right; agentscan picker)
#   default  no geometry               (tmux's own default popup size)

# is always non-empty and "$@" is guaranteed non-empty (checked above).
